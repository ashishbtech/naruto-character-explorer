# 🥷 Naruto Character Explorer

Naruto Character Explorer is an upcoming interactive character search web application inspired by the Naruto anime universe.

This project will allow users to search for a shinobi by name and view detailed information such as clan, village affiliation, jutsu, ninja rank, and current status. It is being built to practice API integration, modern JavaScript, and clean UI design.
