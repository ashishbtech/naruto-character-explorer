# 🥷 Naruto Character Explorer

An interactive character search web application inspired by the Naruto universe. This project allows users to search for a shinobi by name and instantly view detailed information such as clan, village affiliation, jutsu, ninja rank, and current status.

The goal of this project was to practice real-world API integration, modern JavaScript (ES6+), dynamic DOM manipulation, and themed UI design while building something inspired by one of my favorite anime worlds.
